"Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice? ",Badly Drawn Boy,1,1,"To answer the question about which performance act has a higher instrument-to-person ratio, we need to consider the typical setups of **Badly Drawn Boy** and **Wolf Alice**.

1. **Badly Drawn Boy**: This is the stage name of Damon Gough, a solo artist who often performs with a backing band. However, as a solo act, the instrument-to-person ratio can vary depending on the performance setup. He often plays multiple instruments himself, such as guitar, piano, and others, but the ratio is generally lower compared to a full band.

2. **Wolf Alice**: This is a four-piece band consisting of Ellie Rowsell (vocals, guitar), Joff Oddie (guitar), Theo Ellis (bass), and Joel Amey (drums). They typically perform with each member playing one or two instruments, resulting in a higher instrument-to-person ratio compared to a solo act like Badly Drawn Boy.

**Conclusion**: **Wolf Alice** likely has a higher instrument-to-person ratio compared to **Badly Drawn Boy**, as they are a full band with each member contributing multiple instruments, whereas Badly Drawn Boy is primarily a solo act.","The context provided does not mention anything about Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice, nor does it provide information about their performance acts or instrument-to-person ratios.

Badly Drawn Boy is primarily a solo act by Damon Gough, who often performs with a band but is known for his solo work. Wolf Alice, on the other hand, is a band with multiple members, typically including a guitarist, bassist, drummer, and vocalist. 

Given this information, **Wolf Alice** likely has a higher instrument-to-person ratio compared to Badly Drawn Boy, as they are a full band with multiple instruments being played by different members. Badly Drawn Boy, as a solo act, would have a lower ratio unless accompanied by additional musicians.
