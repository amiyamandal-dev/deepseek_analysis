"Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice? ",Badly Drawn Boy,1,1,"To determine which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, we need to know the number of instruments and the number of people in each act.

Badly Drawn Boy is primarily a solo artist, Damon Gough, who often performs with a band. However, as a solo act, the instrument to person ratio can be quite high if he plays multiple instruments himself.

Wolf Alice is a band consisting of four members: Ellie Rowsell, Joff Oddie, Theo Ellis, and Joel Amey. They typically play a standard rock band setup with guitars, bass, drums, and vocals.

Without specific numbers of instruments used in their performances, it's challenging to give an exact ratio. However, generally speaking, a solo artist like Badly Drawn Boy could have a higher instrument to person ratio if he uses multiple instruments himself compared to a band like Wolf Alice, where the instruments are divided among four members.","To determine which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, we need to know the number of instruments and the number of people in each act.

1. **Badly Drawn Boy**: Badly Drawn Boy is primarily a solo artist, Damon Gough, who typically plays multiple instruments himself. However, during performances, he may have additional musicians, but generally, it's centered around him.

2. **Wolf Alice**: Wolf Alice is a band consisting of four members. They typically use a standard band setup with guitars, bass, drums, and sometimes keyboards or other instruments.

Given this information:

- Badly Drawn Boy, as a solo act, might have a higher instrument to person ratio if he plays multiple instruments himself during a performance.
- Wolf Alice, being a four-member band, would generally have a lower instrument to person ratio as the instruments are divided among the members.

Therefore, Badly Drawn Boy likely has a higher instrument to person ratio compared to Wolf Alice.","[{'text': 't: i\ns: e', 'metadata': {'title': 'doc-1', 'id': 1}, 'score': 0.25179019570350647}, {'text': 't: i\ns: e', 'metadata': {'title': 'doc-0', 'id': 0}, 'score': 0.25179019570350647}]"
