The first thing I notice is that it starts with the number 7, which might be a section heading or something else. Then it talks about \"What we cover,\" listing insured events like storms, floods, and fires, including bushfires. So, the building is covered for loss or damage from these specific events.\\n\\nNext, there\\'s a section on legal liability. It mentions covering legal liabilities where the policyholder might have to pay compensation for death or bodily injury to others or loss/damage to their property in certain situations.\\n\\nThen it moves on to additional covers that come with the policy at no extra cost, directing readers to page 53 for more info. After that, there are optional covers that require paying extra, shown on the certificate of insurance, and they refer to section 6 on page 67.\\n\\nSo, breaking this down, the main topics seem to be what\\'s covered by the base policy and additional or optional covers. The key points under \"What we cover\" are specific perils like storms, floods, fires. Legal liability is another main point, covering third-party incidents with certain conditions. Then there are two types of additional covers: mandatory ones included for free and optional ones that require extra payment.\\n\\nI need to make sure the summary captures these elements clearly without getting too detailed. Maybe structure it as a list where each main topic has its key points.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe insurance policy document outlines coverage under three main categories:\\n\\n1. **Insured Events**: The base policy covers loss or damage to the building due to specific events such as storms, floods, and fires (including bushfires).\\n\\n2. **Legal Liability**: The policy provides coverage for legal liabilities where the policyholder may need to pay compensation for third-party death, bodily injury, or property damage in certain situations.\\n\\n3. **Additional Covers**:\\n   - **Included Covers**: Additional covers are provided at no extra cost, detailed on page 53.\\n   - **Optional Covers**: These require an additional payment and are listed on the certificate of insurance, with further information available on page 67.\\n\\nThis summary highlights the core coverage areas and additional considerations for the policyholder.'}"
